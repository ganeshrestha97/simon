# Simon
________


## Background story:
Two high school best friends were chatting and goofing around when they suddenly received a word that they got exact same score in their SAT's.

Despite of being best friends, they always welcomed friendly competition between eachother, for they believed that it helped them grow. And at the time SAT score was supposed to be the ultimate challenge between them.

However, since they each ended up with the same score, they now have to find another way to conclude who's got edge on who.

After much discussion and research they decided to settle it once and for all by playing a single round of game. A game that will test their memory and intuitive skills. The game called Simon! A game that will decide who's victor in this final showdown.

## Game Play:

This is a memory skill game which consists of four colored buttons, each buttons make a specific sound when pressed. The game starts when a player clicks the start button and one of the color button lights up at random to which the player must click on the same button to level up. If the player follows the same sequence set by the program then they level up and the game extends by making the sequence longer and thus harder to remember.

Each time the player follows the right sequence, the game extends by one sequence until they reach the point where the wining parameter is met. That is when the player wins the game and it'll restart with new sequence for the new game.

However, if the player presses the wrong button by failing to follow the sequence set by the program then they loose the game and would have to start a new game with new color sequence.
